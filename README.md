This repository contains the code for my Bachelor's thesis, titled "*Prediction of song popularity with a textual and audio based approach*", and available for download at http://tesi.luiss.it/31943/.

The thesis proposes a blended approach for predicting song popularity combining some textual based approaches presented in Berger and Packard 2018 and 2020, with an audio based one suggested in Lee and Lee 2018.

## Data
Since two types of analysis are carried out, ie. Text Mining and Audio Mining, there are two datasets: 
- one with lyrics and other song features, scraped from seven major genres of *Billboard’s digital download rankings*
- another one with the corresponding audio tracks, downloaded in mp3 format from *Youtube.com*

### Billboard Scraping
