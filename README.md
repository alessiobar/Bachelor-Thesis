This repository contains the code for my Bachelor's thesis, titled "*Prediction of song popularity with a textual and audio based approach*", and available for download at http://tesi.luiss.it/31943/.

The thesis proposes a blended approach for predicting song popularity combining some textual based approaches presented in Berger and Packard 2018 and 2020, with an audio based one suggested in Lee and Lee 2018.

## Data

The former is made of *Weekly Song Ranking List* is scraped from *Billboard.com* (The Hot 100 Chart*)
